Extension currently supports Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. To set up the extension, go to its options page.

1. Add a URL: e.g. github.com
2. Set the MAC type: e.g. It only accepts MAC addresses with the "-" delimiter, so select '"-" delimiter'.
3. Whenever you paste a MAC address (on github.com), it will be automatically formatted to use "-".

Currently supports MAC addresses with no delimiters, "-", and ":". May not work on every site (tested on reddit, and seemed to break the text box). For the site you define, the extension checks if one of the defined sites contains the current URL.
